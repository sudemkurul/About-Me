    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        I am a first-year undergraduate student of <strong>Political Science and Public Administration</strong> at <strong>Istanbul Medipol University</strong>, with a profound academic interest in <strong>political theory, legal studies, history,</strong> and <strong>cultural anthropology</strong>. My research focuses on understanding how political systems, legal frameworks, and social structures interact to shape governance and societal dynamics across diverse contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past few years, I have complemented my university studies with extensive independent research and rigorous online courses delivered by leading global institutions, including <strong>Cambridge, Edinburgh, Yale,</strong> and <strong>Harvard</strong>.

        Alongside my coursework, I am actively developing a series of independent research projects and online platforms where I publish essays, book analyses, and articles on history, politics, and law.
