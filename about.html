    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        I am a first-year political science and public administration student at <strong>Istanbul Medipol University</strong> with a strong passion for <strong>history, politics, law,</strong> and <strong>cultural anthropology</strong>. My academic journey is focused on exploring how political systems, legal frameworks, and social structures shape societies worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past few years, I have expanded my knowledge through intensive academic research and by completing various online courses from leading institutions such as <strong>Cambridge, Edinburgh, Yale,</strong> and <strong>Harvard</strong>. These courses have strengthened my understanding of global politics, legal theory, and public policy.
      </p>

      <h2>1) Projects & Research</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond my academic studies, I work on independent projects—including blogs and websites—where I publish essays, book analyses, and research on history, politics, and law. These platforms let me combine academic insights with personal interests and share my work with a broader audience.
